# MenoLearn_Chatbot_RAG
Chatbot for the MenoLearn menopause education project with the UCSD Cognitive Science Dept. using the ChatGPT API. This is the repo for the fine-tuning version of the model. The idea with this version is to add to GPT's pretraining with a curated dataset and special training.

This will be compared with the RAG version later.
