The risks of hormone therapy differ depend- ing on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treat- ment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing therapy.Hormone therapy is FDA approved for four indications: mod- erate to severe VMS; prevention of osteoporosis in postmen- opausal women; treatment of hypoestrogenism caused by hypogonadism, BO, or POI; and treatment of moderate to se- vere vulvovaginal symptoms. FDA guidance for treatment of genitourinary symptoms related to menopause in the absence of indications for systemic ET suggests the use of low-dose topical vaginal ET. The therapeutic goal should be to use the most appropriate, often lowest, effective dose of systemic ET consistent with treat- ment goals. The appropriate dose of progestogen is added to provide endometrial protection if a woman has a uterus, unless CEE is combined with BZA.The appropriate formulation, dose, and route of administra- tion of progestogen is needed to counter the proliferative ef- fects of systemic estrogen on the endometrium."," Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. Patient preference for compounded bioidentical hormone therapy should be discussed. Patient preference alone should not be used to justify use of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy.The decision regarding duration of treatment and when to stop hormone therapy must be consid- ered in the context of the individualized risk-benefit profile, as well as the woman’s personal preferences. Decision-making sur- rounding the use of hormone therapy should be individualized, with recommendations for the use of the appropriate dose, dura- tion, regimen, and route of administration required to manage a woman’s symptoms and to meet treatment goals.","Hormone therapy remains the gold standard for relief of VMS. – Estrogen-alone therapy can be used for symptomatic women
without a uterus. For symptomatic women with a uterus, EPT or a TSEC protects against endometrial neoplasia. Considering the dose, there are no appreciable differences in the efficacy of oral versus nonoral formulations, but EPT appears slightly more effective than ET alone. Micronized progesterone 300 mg nightly significantly de- creases VMS (hot flashes and night sweats) compared with placebo and improves sleep. Synthetic progestins have also shown benefit for VMS in some studies. No long-term study results are available, and use of progestogens without estro- gen for either indication is off-label.","Low-dose vaginal ET preparations are effective and generally safe for the treatment of GSM, with minimal systemic absorp- tion, and are preferred over systemic therapies when ET is used only for genitourinary symptoms.  Hormone ther- apy is FDA approved to treat moderate to severe symptoms of VVA and dyspareunia because of menopause but with the pref- erence for low-dose vaginal therapy if solely prescribed for vul- var or vaginal symptoms. For women with breast cancer, low-dose vaginal ET should be prescribed in consultation with their oncologists. Progestogen therapy is not required with low-dose vaginal es-trogen, but RCT data are lacking beyond 1 year. 
Nonestrogen prescription FDA-approved therapies that im- prove VVA in postmenopausal women include ospemifene
and intravaginal DHEA  for treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA resulting from menopause. One oral therapy (a SERM) has FDA approval as well. Estrogen therapy, specifically vaginal ET, is an effective treatment. for GSM, with no evidence to suggest a difference in safety or ef- ficacy between the various vaginal ET preparations. Because of the potential risk of small increases in circulating estrogens,87 the decision to use low-dose vaginal ET in women with breast cancer should be made in conjunction with their on- cologists.Nonestrogen therapies that improve genitourinary symptoms and are approved for relief of dyspareunia in postmenopausal women include ospemifene94 and intravaginal DHEA.95. Systemic hormone therapy does not improve urinary inconti- nence and may increase the incidence of stress urinary incon- tinence.Low-dose vaginal ET may provide benefit for urinary symp- toms, including prevention of recurrent UTIs, overactive blad- der, and urge incontinence. Hormone therapy does not have FDA approval for any uri- nary health indication. hhhhhhhhhhhBoth systemic hormone therapy and low-dose vaginal ET in- crease lubrication, blood flow, and sensation of vaginal tissues. Systemic hormone therapy generally does not improve sex- ual function, sexual interest, arousal, or orgasmic response independent of its effect on GSM. If sexual function or libido are concerns in women with men- opause symptoms, transdermal ET may be preferable over oral ET because of minimal effect on sex hormone-binding globulin and free testosterone levels. (LLow-dose vaginal ET improves sexual function in postmeno- pausal women with GSM. Nonestrogen alternatives FDA approved for dyspareunia in- clude ospemifene and intravaginal DHEA.","""Quality of life can be applied to one’s mental and physical health"": Menopause symptoms are associated with poorer health-related and menopause-specific quality of life, and Systemic hormone therapy can improve menopause-specific quality of life in women experiencing menopause symptoms. There is some evidence that ET has antidepressant effects of similar magnitude to that observed with antidepressant agents when administered to depressed perimenopausal women with or without concomitant VMS.  Estrogen therapy is ineffective as a treatment for depressive disorders in postmenopausal women. Such evidence suggests a possible window of opportunity for the effective use of ET for the management of depressive disorders during the peri- menopause. Some evidence that ET enhances mood and improves well-being in nondepressed perimenopausal women.  the evidence is not sufficient to recommend estrogen-based therapies for preventing depression in asymp tomatic perimenopausal or postmenopausal women, and the
risks and benefits must be weighed. Estrogen-based therapies may augment clinical response to antidepressants in midlife and older women, preferably when also indicated for other menopause symptoms such as VMS. Data on EPT or for
different progestogens are sparse and inconclusive. Estrogen is not government approved to treat mood disturbance. ","Hormone therapy improves sleep in women with bothersome nighttime VMS by reducing nighttime awakenings. Estrogen may have some effect on sleep, independent of VMS. Hormone therapy in the form of low-dose estrogen or proges- togen may improve chronic insomnia in menopausal women, with 14 of 23 studies reviewed showing positive results. Oral MP has mildly sedating effects, reducing wakefulness without affecting daytime cognitive functions, possibly through a GABA-agonistic effect,79 and should therefore be adminis- tered at night. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that MP improved sleep-onset latency. 

• Estrogen therapy appears to have beneficial effects on skin thickness and elasticity and collagen when given at meno- pause. Hormone therapy appears to decrease the risk of neovascular and soft drusen age-related macular degeneration but not early or late-stage macular degeneration. Estrogen therapy appears to reduce intraocular pressure and mitigate the risk for open-angle glaucoma in Black women. In small trials, hormone therapy appears to decrease dizziness or vertigo and improve postural balance.","only addresses Compounded bioidentical hormones: presents safety concerns,  lack of scientific efficacy and safety data, and lack of a label outlining risks. Salivary and urine hormone testing to determine dosing are unreliable and not recommended. Serum hormone testing is rarely needed. Patient preference alone should not be used to justify the use of compounded bioidentical hormone preparations, particularly when government- regulated bioidentical hormone preparations are available. Situations in which compounded bioidentical hormones could be considered include allergies to ingredients in a government- approved formulation or dosages not available in government- approved products."," The FDA indication for hormone therapy includes prevention, but not treatment, of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Nonestrogen medications are preferred for treatment of existing osteoporosis.low- est dose-approved estradiol weekly patch (0.014 mg/d) appears effective in treating VMS,66 it is FDA approved only for preven- tion of osteoporosis.  Hormone therapy prevents bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, with dose-related effects on bone density,  reduces fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal women. Hormone therapy significantly reduces the diagnosis of new-onset type 2 DM, but it is not government approved for this indication. Hormone therapy is not contraindicated in otherwise healthy women with preexisting type 2 DM and may be beneficial in terms of glycemic control when used for menopause symp- tom management. Although hormone therapy may help attenuate abdominal adipose accumulation and weight gain associated with the menopause transition, the effect is small. 
 In the absence of more definitive findings, hormone therapy is not recommended at any age to prevent or treat a decline in cognitive function or dementia. Hormone therapy is not government approved for primary or secondary cardioprotection. ","The increased absolute risks associated with EPT and ET are rare (<10/10,000/y) and include increased risk for VTE and gallbladder disease. In addition, EPT carries a rare increased risk for stroke and breast cancer, and if estrogen is inadequately opposed, an increased risk of endometrial hy- perplasia and endometrial cancer. Risk of gallstones, cholecystitis, and cholecystectomy is in- creased with ET and EPT. (Level I)Initiating hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years increased the risk for dementia. The effect of hormone therapy may be modified by baseline cognitive function, with more favorable effects in women with normal cognitive function before hormone therapy initi- ation. Estrogen therapy may have cognitive benefits when initiated immediately after hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy, but hormone therapy in the early natural postmenopause pe- riod has neutral effects on cognitive function. For healthy symptomatic women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, the favorable effects of hormone therapy on CHD and all-cause mortality should be considered against potential rare increases in risks of breast cancer, VTE, and stroke. Personal and familial risk of CVD, stroke, VTE, and breast cancer should be considered when initiating hormone therapy. Reduced risk of CHD in women who initiate hormone therapy when aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause on- set.Women who initiate hormone therapy aged older than 60 years or more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset are at higher absolute risks of CHD, VTE, and stroke.The risk of breast cancer related to hormone therapy use is low, with estimates indicating a rare occurrence. No additive effect of underlying breast cancer risk  and hormone therapy use on breast cancer incidence. Systemic hormone therapy is generally not advised for survi- vors of breast cancer, although hormone therapy use may be considered in women with severe VMS. Regular breast cancer surveillance is advised for all post- menopausal women per current breast cancer screening guidelines, including those who use hormone therapy. Unopposed systemic ET in a postmenopausal woman with an intact uterus increases the risk of endometrial cancer, so ade- quate progestogen is recommended. Low-dose vaginal ET does not appear to increase endome- trial cancer risk. Use of oral contraceptives is associated with a significant reduction in ovarian cancer risk. reduced incidence of colo- rectal cancer in current hormone therapy users, with reduced mortality.

Benefits may exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference. They should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. When women present during the menopausal transition, we suggest using this opportunity to address bone health, smoking cessation, alcohol use, cardiovascular risk assessment and management, and cancer screening and prevention. For menopausal women < 60 years of age or < 10 years past menopause with bothersome VMS (with or without additional climacteric symptoms) who do not have contraindications or excess cardiovascular or breast cancer risks and are willing to take menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), we suggest initiating estrogen therapy (ET) for those without a uterus and estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT) for those with a uterus. We suggest a shared decision-making approach to decide about the choice of formulation, starting dose, the route of administration of MHT, and how to tailor MHT to each woman's individual situation, risks, and treatment goals. For symptomatic postmenopausal women with a uterus and without contraindications, we suggest the combination of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE)/bazedoxifene (BZA) (where available) as an option for relief of VMS and prevention of bone loss.or women with bothersome VMS and climacteric symptoms and without contraindications, we suggest tibolone (in countries where available) as an alternative to MHT. We recommend against adding tibolone to other forms of MHT.For young women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), premature or early menopause, without contraindications, we suggest taking MHT until the time of anticipated natural menopause, when the advisability of continuing MHT can be reassessed. We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. For women preparing to discontinue MHT, we suggest a shared decision-making approach to elicit individual preference about adopting a gradual taper vs abrupt discontinuation. For symptomatic postmenopausal women with a uterus and without contraindications, we suggest the combination of CEE/BZA (where available) as an option for relief of VMS and prevention of bone loss. ","Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference.

Evaluating risk facilitates individual counseling and decisions regarding MHT for symptom relief","Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric. ET is specifically the most effective treatment for VMS and improving QOL in symptomatic women (38). In a dose-dependent manner, MHT reduces hot flash frequency . For menopausal women < 60 years of age or < 10 years past menopause with bothersome VMS (with or without additional climacteric symptoms) who do not have contraindications or excess cardiovascular or breast cancer risks and are willing to take menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), we suggest initiating estrogen therapy (ET) for those without a uterus and estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT) for those with a uterus. Other options are available for those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications because these patients should not use MHT.  For women seeking pharmacological management for moderate to severe VMS for whom MHT is contraindicated, or who choose not to take MHT, we recommend selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or gabapentin or pregabalin (if there are no contraindications).  the limited evidence available suggests that standard-dose MHT is more effective than nonhormonal agents. For those women seeking relief of moderate to severe VMS who are not responding to or tolerating the nonhormonal prescription therapies, SSRIs/SNRIs or gabapentin or pregabalin, we suggest a trial of clonidine (if there are no contraindications). Tibolone alleviates VMS with equivalent or lesser potency than conventional MHT.  For women with bothersome VMS and climacteric symptoms and without contraindications, we suggest tibolone (in countries where available) as an alternative to MHT. Recommend against adding tibolone to other forms of MHT.","Low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. Systemic estrogen administration effectively treats VVA and improves symptoms of overactive bladder and recurrent urinary tract infections . With lower doses of systemic MHT, vaginal symptoms may persist and local therapy may be needed  For postmenopausal women with symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), we suggest a trial of vaginal moisturizers to be used at least twice weekly. For women who do not produce sufficient vaginal secretions for comfortable sexual activity, we suggest vaginal lubricants. For women without a history of hormone- (estrogen) dependent cancers who are seeking relief from symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) (including VVA) that persist despite using vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, we recommend low-dose vaginal ET. For women taking raloxifene, without a history of hormone- (estrogen) dependent cancers, who develop symptoms of GSM (including VVA) that do not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest adding low-dose vaginal ET. For women using low-dose vaginal ET, we suggest against adding a progestogen (ie, no need for adding progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia).  For women using vaginal ET who report postmenopausal bleeding or spotting, we recommend prompt evaluation for endometrial pathology. For treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia associated with vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women without contraindications, we suggest a trial of ospemifene. Stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence, and mixed urinary incontinence increase in women taking oral ET and EPT. ","Less focus on how to address mental health symptoms.  As opposed to the conclusions in the 2005 National Institutes of Health State of the Science consensus regarding the uncertain relationship between mood and menopause, more recent longitudinal studies now support an association of the menopause transition with depressed mood, major depressive episodes, and anxiety. Anxiety symptoms increase during the menopause transition and are associated with an increased likelihood of a major depressive disorder (49). ET may improve mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms during or shortly after the menopause transition, whereas antidepressant therapy remains appropriate treatment for major depression","mentioned but not addressed treatment. Research has suggested (but not proven) a direct relationship between menopause and mood changes, mild depressive symptoms, anxiety, irritability, arthralgias, loss of libido, palpitations, skin dryness, fatigue, and reduction in QOL (38, 39). Joint pain or stiffness and general aches or pains were improved in women receiving EPT (38, 44, 52). Joint pain increased slightly after discontinuation of treatment. Large placebo-controlled trials reported significantly fewer sleep disturbances with MHT use (44), but additional data are required for definitive conclusions. ","All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures. For postmenopausal women with mild or less bothersome hot flashes, we suggest a series of steps that do not involve medication, such as turning down the thermostat, dressing in layers, avoiding alcohol and spicy foods, and reducing obesity and stress. For women seeking relief of VMS with over-the-counter (OTC) or complementary medicine therapies, we suggest counseling regarding the lack of consistent evidence for benefit for botanicals, black cohosh, omega-3-fatty acids, red clover, vitamin E, and mind/body alternatives including anxiety control, acupuncture, paced breathing, and hypnosis"," Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, along with limiting alcohol consumption will minimize bone loss and reduce the risk of falls and fractures. ET reduces menopause-related bone loss, lowers the risk of fragility fractures in older women, and reduces the incidence of self-reported diabetes. In addition, combined EPT reduced the risk of colorectal cancer and, in cumulative follow-up of the WHI, endometrial cancer. unclear stance on use of MHT for primary or secondary disease prevention, leaning towards no.  MHT reduced the prevalence of self-reported diabetes by 14 to 19% (44), an effect that did not persist after therapy was discontinued ","For women < age 60 or < 10 years past menopause onset considering MHT for menopausal symptom relief, we suggest evaluating the baseline risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and breast cancer and taking this risk into consideration when advising for or against MHT and when selecting type, dose, and route of administration. For women at high risk of CVD, we suggest initiating nonhormonal therapies to alleviate bothersome VMS (with or without climacteric symptoms) over MHT.  For women with moderate risk of CVD, we suggest transdermal estradiol as first-line treatment, alone for women without a uterus or combined with micronized progesterone (or another progestogen that does not adversely modify metabolic parameters) for women with a uterus, because these preparations have less untoward effect on blood pressure, triglycerides, and carbohydrate metabolism. For women at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) who request MHT, we recommend a nonoral route of ET at the lowest effective dose, if not contraindicated; for women with a uterus, we recommend a progestogen (for example, progesterone and dydrogestone) that is neutral on coagulation parameters. For women at high or intermediate risk of breast cancer considering MHT for menopausal symptom relief, we suggest nonhormonal therapies over MHT to alleviate bothersome VMS.  We recommend against using tibolone in women with a history of breast cancer. We recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT and emphasizing the importance of adhering to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.  In women with a history of breast or endometrial cancer, who present with symptomatic GSM (including VVA), that does not respond to nonhormonal therapies, we suggest a shared decision-making approach that includes the treating oncologist to discuss using low-dose vaginal ET.  For women with a history of breast cancer presenting with dyspareunia, we recommend against ospemifene. For postmenopausal women < 65 years of age and at high risk of osteoporosis, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry assessment of bone mineral density contributes to risk assessment. ET for the relief of menopausal symptoms prevents bone loss and reduces fracture risk. Unopposed ET increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer (38, 65, 66), whereas concurrent progestogen therapy (Table 5) for at least 12 days per month reduces this risk (18, 44, 67) and is recommended for all women with a uterus. The levonorgestrel intrauterine device (not approved for a postmenopausal indication in the United States, but widely used in other countries and, increasingly, off-label in United States) appears effective at minimizing hyperplasia and endometrial cancer risk, especially in obese wome. nonsignificant trend toward an increase in stroke risk with EPT in women ages 50 to 59. oral ET increases VTE risk in women ages 50 to 59 ",Mainly USA,x,"Cynthia A.

No breast cancer history: Offer vaginal oestrogen to people with genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause (including those using systemic HRT) and review regularly as per the recommendations on reviews in this guideline. Explain that serious adverse effects are very rare, vaginal oestrogen is absorbed locally – a minimal amount is absorbed into the bloodstream when compared with systemic HRT, but this is unlikely to have a significant effect throughout the body. Make a shared decision with the person about whether to use an oestrogen cream, gel, tablet, pessary or ring.  Advise people with genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause that vaginal oestrogen can be used on its own or in combination with non-hormonal moisturisers or lubricants. For people with genitourinary symptoms in whom vaginal oestrogen preparations are contraindicated, or for people who would prefer not to use vaginal oestrogen, consider non-hormonal vaginal moisturisers or lubricants. Consider vaginal prasterone for genitourinary symptoms if vaginal oestrogen, or non-hormonal moisturisers or lubricants have been ineffective or are not tolerated. Consider ospemifene as an oral treatment for genitourinary symptoms, if the use of locally applied treatments is impractical, for example, because of disability. [2024]

",,Journal of Menopausal Medicine,2020,The 2020 Menopausal Hormone Therapy Guidelines,"Menstrual hormone therapy is The most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Prior to initiating MHT: The examinations required to be conducted prior to MHT are history taking, physical examination, and examinations for liver function, kidney function, anemia, fasting blood sugar, and blood tests of serum lipid profile, followed by mammography, BMD test, and Pap smear screening.
The elective examinations required to be conducted prior to MHT are thyroid function test, breast ultrasonography, and endometrial biopsy conducted as individualized tests according to individual risk factors. All exams are conducted at an interval of 1–2 years. MHT is shown to improve health-related, global, and menopause-specific quality of life. . For women with the uterus intact, estrogen must be administered together with progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.It is better to start MHT immediately once symptoms appear before or after menopause.
 There is no need to impose a limit on the duration of MHT as long as an effective minimum dose is used, if women are well aware of the potential benefits and risks, and a regular clinical follow-up observation is accompanied.
Bioidentical MHT may be administered in excessive or very low doses, with no guidelines established for administration and routine tests, including blood tests. There is a lack of evidence of the effects and safety of complementary therapy.
DHEA and ospemifene may be effective in treating GSM.",customized tests should be conducted for each risk factor based on the basic examination conducted according to the life cycle necessary for women. Undergoing treatment for menopausal transition should be primarily decided according to the frequency and severity of the symptoms of menopause. ,"MHT, low-dose and standard dose both effective. Selective serotonin receptor inhibitor (SSRI)/selective norepinephrine receptor inhibitor (SNRI) showed lesser, but comparable improvement of symptoms. So did gabapentin (900 mg/day)  and pregabalin (150 mg/day), the latter showing the highest imporvement of the non-hormonal therapy, equivelant in efficacy to low-dose therapy. Progestogen (medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA] 10 mg/day, oral megestrol acetate 20 mg/day, and MP 300 mg/day) is known to alleviate VMS with a minimal risk, and it is highly effective in the case of severe VMS. Upon hormone discontnuation, symptoms are lessened as comapred to before the individual started hormone therapy. Tiblone is listed secondary as effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms such as hot flush and VMS. CE/BZA is also effective in alleviating VMS such as hot flush. E/BZA was approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in July 2014 for the treatment of VMS associated with menopause.","MHT. The use of topical estrogen is recommended for the treatment of GSM and recurrent UTIs. Lubricants, vaginal moisturizers, ospemifene, and vaginal DHEA are non-estrogen therapies available for treating urogenital atrophy, but laser therapy could be considered an additional therapy as it alleviate symptoms such as dyspareunia, itchiness, burning sensation, and dryness; however, due to reports of chronic pain, burning sensation, and dyspareunia after receiving laser therapy and the U.S. FDA warned against the safety and effectiveness of laser therapy in July 2018.  For menopausal women with symptoms of an overactive bladder, the primary drug therapy is the combination therapy of an antimuscarinic drug and topical estrogen. Systemic Estrogen Therapy is effective for treating vaginal atrophy but not effective for treating recurrent UTIs, overactive bladder, and urinary incontinence. The effect of MHT on women's sexual dysfunction cannot be clearly proven, and ET or EPT leads to improvement of sexual function and is especially effective in reducing dyspareunia in women in early menopause or with symptoms of menopause . Tibolone is highly valuable for the treatment of women's sexual dysfunction because it is known to show a significant effect on improving vaginal dryness, sexual desire, sexual arousal, and frequency of sexual intercourse when compared with using estrogen or progestogen.  Systemic MHT and low-dose vaginal ET are effective for treating urogenital atrophy and improve sexual function by increasing vaginal lubrication, blood flow, and sensory function as well as improve dyspareunia in particular.  Regarding female MHT for women with HSDD, percutaneous therapy is preferred over oral therapy and tibolone is effective for treating female sexual dysfunction by increasing women's sexual desire and arousal. Testosterone is also effective for the treatment of sexual desire disorder and sexual arousal disorder, which are related to antidepressants. Vaginal testosterone therapy, which is another treatment option for GSM, improves dyspareunia, sexual desire, lubrication, and satisfaction. Combination therapy of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)–bazedoxifene also improves certain sexual functions as well as genitourinary atrophy and dyspareunia in menopausal women. Tiblone is listed secondary as effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms such as hot flush and GSM. Tibolone could be used relatively effectively for treating sexual dysfunction. CE/BZA is also effective in alleviating GSM including urogenital atrophy.","Only Deprrssion is directly addressed.  MHT could show a positive effect, although limited, on affective disorder during menopausal transition.
 In women who experience improvement in depressive symptoms through MHT, symptoms could easily worsen when treatment is stopped. There is lack of clinical evidence supporting the use of MHT for treatment of depression. Mentioned an increase in the score of Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) and an improvement of physical symptoms, depression symptoms, and sleep disorder in the treatment group receiving MH . Mentioned when a premenopausal woman reaches menopause while using SSRI to treat depression, compared with SSRI therapy alone, SSRI in combination with estrogen is more effective in improving depression and shows a faster rate of treatment","not directly addressed, some subtopics such as headaches or fatifue are briefly referenced under VMS or GSM symptoms. Tibolone is associated with a lower incidence of abnormal vaginal bleeding as well as decreased breast density in mammography and reduced breast pain compared with estrogen–progestogen combination therapy. Tibolone could be effectively used for other symptoms such as mood disorder, sleep disorder, concentration disorder, and fatigue. Tibolone is effective in increasing muscle mass.CE/BZA is associated with a low incidence of vaginal bleeding and breast pain and increased breast density.","possible to try alleviating the symptoms via improvement of lifestyles such as weight loss, stress reduction, hypnosis, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Medications such as omega-3, vitamin E, Cimicifuga racemosa, isoflavone, and soybean may be effective, but they are not more effective than placebo. In contrast, S-equol, a metabolite of soy isoflavone, seems to show slightly higher effectiveness than placebo. Pelvic floor muscle training improves the function of vaginal epithelial cells and accelerate the ingrowing of connective tissue. ","In women aged less than 60 years and/or within 10 years of menopause with no evidence of cardiovascular disease, the initiation of hormone therapy could be expected to reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality.
Currently, it is not recommended to initiate MHT solely for primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. The risk of stroke in younger postmenopausal women is rare, and a meta-analysis including a WHI study found no increased risk of stroke in women aged younger than 60 years or who were fewer than 10 years from menopausal onset.  Lower-dose oral hormone therapy or transdermal hormone therapy could relatively reduce the risk of stroke. For women with the uterus, estrogen–progestogen combination therapy should be administrated to protect the endometrium.A sufficient dose of progestogen administered for a sufficient period of 12–14 days per month leads to little increase in risk of endometrial cancer, and continuous administration of combination therapy leads to a reduction in risk of endometrial cancer. Estrogen–progestogen combination therapy reduces the risk of colorectal cancer.Estrogen therapy does not have any effect on colorectal cancer. Executing MHT with the sole purpose of preventing colorectal cancer is not advised. If MHT is started in early menopausal women, a prevention effect against the reduction of cognitive function could be expected although the evidence from randomized controlled studies is lacking.Executing MHT with the sole purpose of preventing worsening or treatment of current cognitive function is not advised. Because MHT prevents menopause-related bone loss and reduces the risk of fracture, it is an appropriate therapy for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in young menopausal women aged less than 60 years or those with less than 10 years since menopause.
Bone protective effect is rapidly lost after stopping MHT.  Standard dose of MHT reduces the femur, vertebral, and non-vertebral fractures in women without osteoporosis. Efficacy of reducing the risk of fracture has not been proven in low- and ultra-low-dose estrogen therapy. MHT is necessary for women with premature ovarian insufficiency (premature menopause) or osteopenia to prevent bone loss. MHT, particularly when combined with exercise, seems to be effective in increasing muscle mass, alleviating its reduction, and improving muscle function and muscle strength.There is a lack of evidence regarding the use of MHT primarily for the purpose of treating and preventing sarcopenia.Non-oral MHT is recommended for women with gallbladder disease. Tibolone increases bone density and reduces vertebral fracture and non-vertebral fracture. Tibolone does not increase invasive breast cancer and endometrial cancer. CE/BZA significantly increases the bone density of the lumbar spine and hip joint. E/BZA was approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in July 2014 for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women without an excised uterus.","The risk of cerebral stroke differs depending on the age range and MHT increases the risk of ischemic stroke in women aged above 60 years.  MHT increases the risk of venous thromboembolism. Particularly, the risk of VTE increases with age and increases in women initiating hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopausal onset. The risk of venous thromboembolism increases in the first 1 to 2 years of MHT and decreases afterwards.
Estrogen therapy has a lower risk of venous thromboembolism than EPT, and if used in the early postmenopausal period, the risk of venous thromboembolism does not increase. Oral estrogen therapy is banned for patients with anamnesis of venous thromboembolism, and they must use transdermal estrogen. After using EPT for an average period of 5.6 years, the risk of breast cancer increased but for women who were starting MHT for the first time, the risk of breast cancer did not increase until the 7th year. In case of ET, the risk of breast cancer reduced after using it for 7.2 years and significantly reduced after 13.2 years of follow-up observation. MHT is not advised for breast cancer patients. Estrogen–progestogen combination therapy does not increase the risk of ovarian cancer. There are reports showing that long-term estrogen therapy increases the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer, but extremely rare. MHT may be considered if non-hormonal therapy is not effective in early endometrial cancer patients with an excised uterus and bilateral appendages when they show menopausal symptoms.  In case of patients with stages III and IV endometrial cancer or high-risk endometrial cancer, non-hormonal therapy should be used to control menopause symptoms. MHT does not increase the occurrence of lung cancer. ET or EPT increases the risk of gallbladder diseases.
Careful monitoring of gallbladder disease is required in women using oral MHT. Because there is a lack of data on the relationship between MHT and migraine, it cannot be concluded that migraine is a contraindication for MHT. When Tiblone is used for patients with breast cancer, the recurrence of breast cancer increases. Tibolone does not affect venous thromboembolism and coronary artery disease. In case of administering tibolone to patients aged above 60 years, there is an increased incidence of stroke. The safety of CE/BZA for the endometrium has been proven. No RCTs have been conducted with breast cancer, fracture, and cardiovascular disorder as the primary endpoints.

These guidelines should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of treatment or procedure. Variations in practice may be warranted based on the needs of the individual patient, resources, and limitations unique to the institution or type of practice.BackgroundMenopause  is  the  permanent  cessation  of  menstruation  that  occurs  after  the  loss  of  ovarian  activity.  By  defini-tion, menopause cannot be determined to have occurred until  1  year  after  the  last  menstrual  period.  In  North  America, the median age of menopause is 51 years. Most women  begin  to  undergo  the  physiologic  changes  asso-ciated  with  menopause  in  the  years  preceding  the  final  menstrual  period.  This  interval  is  often  referred  to  as  perimenopause, the climacteric, or––more recently––the menopausal transition (6). The  menopausal  transition  is  marked  by  fluctua-tions  in  hormone  levels  as  ovarian  function  begins  to  slow  down.  Serum  levels  of  estradiol  and  progester-one  decrease  and  follicle-stimulating  hormone  levels  increase,  resulting  in  physiologic  changes  and  clinical  symptoms. Although women report experiencing a vari-ety  of  menopausal  symptoms,  vasomotor  (hot  flushes)  and  vaginal  symptoms  are  the  most  closely  associated  with the hormonal changes of the menopausal transition (6, 7).Vasomotor SymptomsThe sudden sensation of extreme heat in the upper body, particularly  the  face,  neck,  and  chest,  is  referred  to  as  a  hot  flush.  These  episodes,  which  typically  last  1–5  minutes (8), can be characterized by perspiration, flush-ing, chills, clamminess, anxiety, and, on occasion, heart palpitations (9). Vasomotor symptoms may also interfere with  sleep  and  cause  chronic  sleep  disruption  in  some  women (10). Vasomotor symptom episodes vary in frequency and duration.  Studies  show  that  87%  of  women  who  report  hot flushes experience these symptoms on a daily basis, with approximately 33% experiencing more than 10 hot flushes  per  day.  Published  reports  also  indicate  that  symptoms may persist longer than the previous estimate Management of Menopausal SymptomsVasomotor  and  vaginal  symptoms  are  cardinal  symptoms  of  menopause.  Vasomotor  symptoms  can  be  particu-larly  troubling  to  women  and  are  the  most  commonly  reported  menopausal  symptoms,  with  a  reported  prevalence  of  50–82%  among  U.S.  women  who  experience  natural  menopause  (1, 2).  The  occurrence  of  vasomotor  symptoms  increases during the transition to menopause and peaks approximately 1 year after the final menstrual period (3–5). The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  provide  evidence-based  guidelines  for  the  treatment  of  vasomotor  and  vaginal  symptoms  related  to  natural  and  surgical  menopause.

. ","Systemic hormone therapy (HT), with estrogen alone or in combination with progestin, is the most effective therapy for vasomotor symptoms related to menopause. Data do not support the use of progestin-only medications, testosterone, or compounded bioidentical hormones for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. Given the variable response to HT and the associated risks, it is recommended that health care providers individualize care and treat women with the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration that is needed to relieve vasomotor symptoms. As an alternative to the use of a progestin for preventing endometrial hyperplasia with estrogen therapy, a combined daily oral preparation of conjugated estrogen and bazedoxifene has been approved by the FDA for treatment of vasomotor symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with a uterus.progestin alone is not considered a first-line therapy for the management of vasomotor symptoms. Tibolone appears to have a beneficial effect on bone density, vasomotor symptoms, and vaginal symptoms without estrogenic effects on the uterus or breasts (61, 62). However, given its limited safety and efficacy data compared with HT, tibolone is not considered a first-line therapy for menopausal symptoms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs), clonidine, and gabapentin are effective alternatives to HT for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms related to menopause","Estrogen therapy effectively alleviates atrophic vaginal symptoms related to menopause. Local therapy is advised for the treatment of women with only vaginal symptoms. Local vaginal estradiol and local conjugated equine estrogen, which can be administered in cream, ring, and tablet formulations, are effective in treating atrophic vaginitis in menopausal women.  Studies demonstrate that two currently available FDA-approved agents, raloxifene and tamoxifen, are not effective for the treatment of menopausal vaginal symptoms.   However, studies suggest that ospemifene, a novel estrogen agonist and estrogen antagonist improves vaginal atrophy without stimulating the endometrium.  The FDA approved ospemifene for treating moderate-to-severe dyspareunia in postmenopausal women. Nonestrogen water-based or silicone-based vaginal lubricants and moisturizers may alleviate vaginal symptoms related to menopause. These products may be particularly helpful in women who do not wish to use hormonal therapies. There are insufficient data to support the use of herbal remedies or soy products for the treatment of vaginal symptoms. ",x,Testosterone alone is currently not FDA-approved for use in women.,"Evidence is lacking to support superiority claims of compounded bioidentical hormones over conventional menopausal HT (this is also discussed in Committee Opinion Number 532, Compounded Bioidentical Menopausal Therapy). Conventional HT is preferred given the available data. Several natural products have been used for the management of vasomotor symptoms. In the United States, none of these complementary therapies are regulated by the FDA and have not been tested for safety, efficacy, or purity because they are considered nutritional supplements. Data do not show that phytoestrogens, herbal supplements, and lifestyle modifications are efficacious for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. Despite limited supporting data, common sense lifestyle solutions such as layering of clothing, maintaining a lower ambient temperature, and consuming cool drinks are reasonable measures for the management of vasomotor symptoms. Women also may be advised to avoid consumption of alcohol and caffeine, which have been associated with increased severity and frequency of vasomotor symptoms. Although there is some evidence that aerobic exercise may improve quality of life and mood in women with vasomotor symptoms, there are insufficient data to recommend exercise for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. There are insufficient data to support the use of herbal remedies or soy products for the treatment of vaginal symptoms.

A FIGO position paper,"Healthcare practitioners can, and must, protect the health and lives of mid-life women by increasing awareness of the symptoms of menopause, providing healthcare options, namely menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), and promoting healthy lifestyle changes. Modifications made before or during the menopausal transition have the most significant impact, even at an older age.
In women with bothersome symptoms of menopause, and absence of contraindications (MHT is the first line of treatment. However, MHT should be personalized based on the patient's history, chronological and menopausal age, physical characteristics, and current health status so that the benefits always outweigh the risks. MHT should be started as soon as possible after menopausal symptoms appear and continued while the risk–benefit ratio is favorable. In healthy, normal-weight early postmenopausal women (approximately 5–8 years from the FMP), the following regimens are generally suitable: oral estrogens or transdermal estradiol at medium doses combined with cyclic or continuous progestogens for endometrial protection;130 tibolone at low to standard doses;55 and tissue selective estrogen complex at the standard dose. In healthy late postmenopausal women, MHT may be continued but seldom begun, with the following regimens:130 low doses of transdermal estradiol89, 91 or low doses of oral estrogens, associated with micronized progesterone or its isomer, dydrogesterone, administered continuously, where there is an indication for endometrial protection; and low-dose tibolone.","Counseling is a fundamental part of health care in the peri- and postmenopause periods. It must include an assessment of the patient's symptoms, needs, desires, and risk profile to address the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on an individual basis and promote a healthy lifestyle.. When deciding to begin MHT, the route of delivery, dose, and type of estrogens or estrogen-progestogens should be carefully pondered based on a woman's characteristics. ","MHT is the first line of treatment.Estrogen-progestogen preparations and the bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogens (BZA/CE) combination are the most successful. Tibolone is also a valid option to provide relief from hot flashes. Whatever the composition, it is advisable to begin any hormone treatment at the lowest effective dose and titrate until control of symptoms is achieved.","Vaginal estrogen therapy is the first-line treatment for the symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy, such as dryness, dyspareunia, itching, and/or burning. It has been proven efficient in ameliorating dysuria, urinary frequency/urgency, and recurrent lower urinary tract infections. Vaginal estrogen therapy is more effective than systemic estrogen therapy in this domainand has an excellent safety profile.It may be used alone, in which case there is no need for endometrial protection or in association with systemic MHT. Estrogen, estrogen-progestogen, and tibolone therapy can still reduce bothersome symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy.The effect of MHT on urinary symptoms depends on the type used. Systemic MHT may cause urinary incontinence or worsen existing urinary symptoms, while vaginal estrogens improve dysuria, frequency, urge and stress incontinence, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Moreover, it is advisable to inform women with pre-existing pelvic organ prolapse that exposure to systemic estrogen-progestogen regimens might negatively affect this problem.  
Orally administered ospemifene is an effective non-estrogen systemic treatment specifically for vulvovaginal atrophy with a good cardiovascular safety profile.
In early postmenopause, transdermal estradiol-based treatment significantly improves overall female sexual function, whereas oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE)-based treatment has less effect. Tibolone is the most effective therapy for restoring sexual function, including desire, sexual interest, and satisfaction, which may be attributed to its combined estrogenic and androgenic properties.Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) oral supplementation may be used in women with low sex drive associated with low levels of circulating dehydroepiandrosterone. Prasterone (vaginal DHEA) may be used efficiently to improve all sexual domains in women with vulvovaginal atrophy and moderate to severe dyspareunia. ","The evidence suggests that the use of MHT, particularly in women who have had surgical menopause, especially when young, is protective against cognitive impairment. Likewise, MHT is likely to be more efficacious on mood when started at a younger age. Furthermore, MHT and antidepressants seem to have a positive cumulative effect on clinical depression.","The benefits of estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) include improved sleep quality.All improvements in sleep domains correlate with a reduction in vasomotor symptoms, except for sleep latency and sleep efficiency,56, 57 demonstrating that the positive effect of EPT on subjective sleep cannot be fully explained by decreased bothersome vasomotor or depressive symptoms. Progesterone alone is also beneficial for sleep.The BZA/CE combination favors sleep in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms. In women who develop hypoactive sexual desire disorder, transdermal testosterone treatment can be used to restore sexual function, bearing in mind that proper dosing should both attain and maintain total testosterone levels in the premenopausal physiological range and that safety data are not available beyond 2 years of treatment.Should be stopped if there is no response within 6 months of treatment. Women with premature and early surgically induced menopause are potential candidates for testosterone therapy.","only addresses Compounded bioidentical hormones: : although there are some exceptions where compounded bioidentical hormone preparations may be acceptable, such as in cases of allergy to ingredients or dosages not available in FDA-approved products,140, 141 FIGO recommends the use of approved, regulated, and monitored bioidentical systemic and vaginal hormone therapies.Lifestyle: Well-tailored MHT should not preclude healthy lifestyle changes, which are the mainstay of primary prevention.

Moderate-intensity physical activity for 150–300 min per week or vigorous-intensity physical activity for 75–150 min per week is recommended to reduce cardiovascular and cancer morbidity and mortality in all adults. Breaking up prolonged sitting with standing or walking for 5 min every 20 min also has a positive impact on cardiovascular risks.148 High-intensity exercise increases lumbar spine BMD.149 Although evidence on the effects of multicomponent exercise programs in postmenopausal and older women remains conflicting, combining resistance training using high-intensity loads and impact-aerobic activities may be the best strategy to enhance muscle and bone mass.Healthy eating, such as that of the Mediterranean diet, and physical activity are pivotal in containing cardiovascular and cancer risks at mid-life and beyond. Maintaining alcohol consumption that meets public health recommendations and avoiding smoking are also key to reducing such risks.Engaging in leisure activities, such as visiting art exhibitions, reading, listening to music, singing, and painting, is positively associated with a lower risk of depression, dementia, and death by any cause.","Menopausal EPT significantly reduces the risk of hip, vertebral, and total fractures, with a parallel increase in bone mineral density (BMD),78 and this benefit persists well after MHT cessation.79-81 Likewise, tibolone increases BMD and reduces fracture risk, even at low doses. Generally speaking, lifetime cumulative estrogen exposure decreases the risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.Estrogen, estrogen-progestogen. and tibolone therapy lower the risk of colorectal cancer in women.","Transdermal estrogens do not increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE),93-95 while oral estradiol, and particularly CEE, do.the use of transdermal estrogens and, where indicated, micronized progesterone or dydrogesterone should be preferred (over norpregnanes, namely nomegestrol acetate and promegestone, norethisterone, as well as MPA,, which increase thrombotic risk) in women who have an increased baseline thrombotic risk. Tibolone does not increase the risk of VTE94 but does increase the risk of stroke in women aged 60–85 years. Therefore, it should not be used in elderly women or those with stroke risk factors, such as hypertension, tobacco smoking, diabetes, and/or atrial fibrillation.The cardiovascular risk profile is acceptable for the BZD/CE combination. Estrogen and EPT improve insulin resistance and lower progression to diabetes in postmenopausal women. The tissue-selective estrogen complex (BZD/CE) has neutral effects on glucose metabolism, while tibolone reduces insulin sensitivity and should not be used in women with prediabetes or diabetes. CEE-only therapy is associated with a lower incidence and mortality of breast cancer incidence,103 and estradiol-only therapy carries no risk for breast cancer.EPT and breast cancer is variable, some progesterones are associated with higher risk and others are not. BZA/CE appears to have a favorable breast-related safety profile as it does not increase mammographic breast density.  Systemic estrogen-only therapy can cause endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in women with an intact uterus and should, therefore, always be combined with a progestogen. Continuous combined EPT is associated with a decreased risk of endometrial cancer, especially in obese women.Tibolone is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, particularly for type 1 endometrial cancer and especially with a long duration of use. Both estrogen-only and estrogen-progestogen hormone therapies are associated with an increased risk of serous and endometrioid ovarian cancer.118 Likewise, tibolone is associated with an increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer overall, particularly serous ovarian cancer, especially with a long duration of use . Women with a history of endometriosis must be informed of the possibility of disease recurrence with MHT. In these women, even when subjected to hysterectomy, continuous combined preparations and tibolone should be considered instead of unopposed estrogens.In women with a history of endometriosis or de novo endometriosis, the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer appears to be increased after estrogen-only treatment, whereas EPT and tibolone therapy are neutral.",intl,x,"Andrea R.

There are limited data to inform patients and clinicians about the best way to discontinue hormone therapy. Some patients will be successful with abrupt discontinuation, whereas others may benefit from weaning. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against routine discontinuation based on age or treatment duration, and advises that the decision to continue or stop hormone therapy should be individualized based on the patient's symptoms and medical history.12","The decision to use hormone therapy depends on clinical presentation, a thorough evaluation of the risks and benefits, and an informed discussion with the patient.Because all systemic estrogen formulations are effective, patient preference should guide the choice of therapy. he decision to use vaginal estrogen formulations for women with a history of hormone-dependent cancers should be based on the woman's preference after consultation with a clinician experienced with hormone therapy. .Patient preference should guide the choice of formulation. he decision to use vaginal estrogen formulations for women with a history of hormone-dependent cancers should be based on the woman's preference after consultation with a clinician experienced with hormone therapy. ","Estrogen therapy or tibolone alleviates VMS in most women [Citation55–57]. Low-dose estrogen therapy can be highly effective. Treatment options include hormone therapy, nonhormonal prescription medications, and clinical hypnosis. Estrogen is the most effective therapy for hot flashes and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication. Because all systemic estrogen formulations are effective, patient preference should guide the choice of therapy, unless there are contraindications . All estrogen medications should be given at the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration necessary to improve symptoms. Because all formulations of unopposed estrogen increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in women with a uterus, these patients should use estrogen plus progestogen for endometrial protection; a continuous regimen appears to be more effective than sequential therapy at reducing the risk of endometrial neoplasia. some patients may prefer nonhormonal medications or may have contraindications to using estrogen. Several antidepressants reduce hot flashes.  Low-dose paroxetine (Brisdelle) is the only nonhormonal medication approved by the FDA to treat hot flashes, although other dosages can be used. Desvenlafaxine (Khedezla) and venlafaxine do not inhibit CYP2D6 and are appropriate alternatives. Starting at a low dose and titrating as necessary should be considered for antidepressants other than low-dose paroxetine. Other nonhormonal options include gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica). These medications should be titrated from a lower dosage.18 Although clonidine is somewhat more effective than placebo, adverse events limit its usefulness for menopausal symptoms.","Treatment options include vaginal estrogen, nonhormonal vaginal moisturizers, and the newer oral systemic estrogen agonist-antagonist ospemifene (Osphena). It is reasonable to try nonhormonal therapy as a first-line option to alleviate vulvovaginal symptoms caused by genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Although not as effective as estrogen, vaginal moisturizers, such as Replens, are an effective treatment for mild vaginal dryness and related dyspareunia. Ospemifene is the only FDA-approved nonhormonal therapy for dyspareunia caused by menopausal atrophy. Short-term studies of ospemifene showed improvement in vaginal dryness. Patients who have genitourinary syndrome of menopause that does not respond to nonhormonal medications or who have a narrow introitus or vagina may benefit from low-dose vaginal estrogen.  Patient preference should guide the choice of formulation. Women using low-dose vaginal estrogen for less than one year should not require a progestogen to decrease the risk of endometrial cancer, but there are no long-term data.Clinicians should consider an endometrial biopsy and/or transvaginal ultrasonography if spotting or bleeding occurs while using low-dose vaginal estrogen. The decision to use vaginal estrogen formulations for women with a history of hormone-dependent cancers should be based on the woman's preference after consultation with a clinician experienced with hormone therapy. Clinicians can inform patients that there is no evidence that using low-dose local estrogen increases the risk of breast cancer recurrence. ",x,x,"Although some women may prefer lifestyle modification, there is no evidence that lowering the ambient temperature; using fans; exercising; or avoiding triggers, such as alcohol and spicy foods, improves hot flashes. . Clinicians should counsel patients that there is no high-quality, consistent evidence that black cohosh, many botanical products, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements are effective for treating hot flashes.  Overall, the low quality and heterogeneity of the studies included in this review do not allow definitive conclusions about the benefits of plant-based complementary therapies. Yoga, paced respiration, acupuncture, exercise, stress reduction, and relaxation therapy also have not been proven to alleviate hot flashes. However, clinical hypnosis  has been shown to reduce hot flashes.
 Data are limited about the safety and effectiveness of compounded bioidentical formulations. There is concern that these unregulated formulations may have similar adverse effects as estrogen medications, such as endometrial hyperplasia. If a patient prefers a bioidentical hormone, FDA-approved medications containing the bioidentical hormone estradiol can be considered; for women with a uterus, micronized progestogen  should be added.",women taking combined estrogen/progestogen therapy in the Women's Health Initiative trial had a reduction in hip fractures.,"Because all formulations of unopposed estrogen increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in women with a uterus, these patients should use estrogen plus progestogen for endometrial protection; a continuous regimen appears to be more effective than sequential therapy at reducing the risk of endometrial neoplasia.

Combined oral contraceptive pill, progetsreone-only regimens ansd systemic MHT. During menopause: For women with an intact uterus, progestogen therapy is required with estrogen to protect the lining of the uterus. Estrogen therapy i s the following option. Breast cancer is a contraindication to the use of MHT. The prescription of individually formulated and compounded hormone preparations is not recommended. Initiating treatment with low-dose MHT will minimize the likelihood of adverse effects. Optimally, women using systemic MHT should have a medical review at 3 months to assess symptom relief and side effects.If symptoms persist on high-dose oral therapy, there is little point increasing beyond the recommended upper dose. Switch to non-oral.","Factors which determine the type and dose of MHT typically prescribed by HCPs include the following:

patient preference;

uterine presence or absence;

contraceptive needs;

symptom type and severity;

comorbidities. Patient-informed choice should always prevail.. The prescribing principle here is that we should ‘first treat the patient, not the result’.","support MHT as the most effective treatment to alleviate VMS. Endometrial protection with a progestogen is essential in non-hysterectomized women. Hysterectomized women should be prescribed estrogen-only therapy unless they have a history of moderate to severe endometriosis. Overweight and obesity, and smoking are risk factors for VMS. Weight reduction may result in reduced VMS in overweight women  and smoking cessation should be encouraged.mExercise, yoga and relaxation methods have not been found to be effective for VMS [Citation11], but these activities may improve sleep and general well-being.Estrogen ± bazedoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator: Conjugated estrogens 0.45 mg/day combined with 20 mg bazedoxifene (BZE) provides an alternative to estrogen–progestogen therapy in a fixed-dose combination. Tibolone provides an alternative to estrogen–progestogen therapy. Tibolone should not be commenced until 12 months after the last natural menstrual period. For hysterectomized women, treatment can be commenced with the onset of bothersome symptoms. It should not be prescribed with other MHT and, like estrogen, is contraindicated in women with breast cancer. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are effective in some, but not all, women with VMS. Paroxetine, 7.5 mg/day, has regulatory approval for VMS in the USA. Fezolinetant is a neurokinin 3B receptor antagonist that acts centrally in the brain to reduce VMS- It may improve sleep quality by reducing nocturnal VMS. Fezolinetant has been approved for the treatment of VMS at a dose of 45 mg/day in some countries. Low-dose oxybutynin has been found to be effective for treatment of VMS either as a standard low-dose or extended-release formulation. Other potential, but probably less effective, options include clonidine and gabapentin/pregabalin. Clonidine may be prescribed for VMS for women who cannot take estrogen at a dose of 100–150 μg/day, although the effect is modest and it is not consistently recommended . Stellate ganglion blockade at the anterolateral aspect of the C6 vertebra on the right side under fluoroscopy can alleviate severe VMS for up to 12 weeks [Citation74]. This procedure requires a highly skilled practitioner and availability is scant.","Ospemifene is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator indicated for vulvo-vaginal atrophy symptoms in postmenopausal women (60 mg/day). Ospemifene has an estrogen-like effect in the vagina (increases superficial cells and decreases parabasal cells, and lowers vaginal pH) and alleviates dyspareunia. These symptoms can be effectively treated with an array of local therapies including intravaginal estrogen preparations or DHEA (prasterone) and intravaginal moisturizers. Concurrent progestogen therapy is not required. Many women require local therapy, in addition to systemic MHT, to relieve urogenital symptoms.","references mental healrth related symptoms (anxiety, depressive symptoms, irritability) as being potentiallya ssociated with VMS/menopause, but does not directly assess the most effective treatments for this category of symptms. Also mood changes as a potential side effect of MHT, but not as its own symptom of menopause.","Transdermal testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women with sexual desire dysfunction, given in a female-appropriate dose, may improve sexual desire, arousal, orgasm and pleasure. There is presently no other evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy for women. Oral DHEA is not effective for the treatment of postmenopausal sexual dysfunction. In addition, systemic DHEA has not been found to be clinically beneficial for the treatment or prevention of any other symptoms or conditions. There is evidence for improved sleep quality with MHT, including tibolone . Despite Asian women being more likely to experience new onset musculoskeletal symptoms at menopause than VMS [Citation27], to date these have not been included in recent guidelines as a primary indication for MHT [Citation4–9]. However, many women with new onset musculoskeletal symptoms will gain relief with MHT. Other commonly reported symptoms that are considered less menopause-specific include fatigue, headaches and impaired memory and concentration]. Overall, cognitive complaints alone are not considered an indication for MHT because clinical trials to date have not demonstrated objective improvement in cognitive performance with MHT over placebo post menopause. Research regarding cognitive effects of MHT during the perimenopause is lacking and urgently required.","The importance of improving lifestyle factors such as good nutrition, being physically active, cessation of smoking, limiting alcohol and stress management should be highlighted, as healthy behaviors confer benefits to all women. While women are commonly told to avoid VMS triggers and dress in layers, there is no evidence that such advice is of value with respect to the severity or frequency of VMS. Activities such as yoga, mindfulness, relaxation and exercise have health benefits but have not been shown to be meaningful treatments for VMS [Citation4–9, Citation11]. Similarly, nutritional supplements and botanicals have not been found to be more effective than placebo for moderately to severely bothersome VMS in robust clinical trials. Hypnosis may diminish VMS frequency and severity in postmenopausal women and can be considered a treatment option for women who are unable to take MHT. Cognitive behavior therapy employs psychotherapeutic behavior modification to help women deal with VMS. Cognitive behavior therapy has been shown to significantly reduce VMS. ","MHT prevents bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women. The UK NICE Guideline [Citation9], and other high-quality guidelines [Citation4, Citation5], recommend MHT for the prevention of osteoporosis and fragility fracture, and MHT is licensed in many countries for this purpose [Citation77, Citation78]. However, guidance as to when postmenopausal women not requiring MHT for symptoms, but who have osteopenia, merit MHT to protect against fragility fracture is starkly absent in osteoporosis guidelines.In asymptomatic postmenopausal women aged <65 years with a T-score of −1.8 or less, MHT use is therefore likely to reduce future fractures, and for many the benefit will outweigh any potential risk.","All women should be reviewed for Cardiovascular disease risk, Diabetes, Urogenital health, Cancer screening. Oral estrogen is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), although the absolute risk is small for women aged <60 years.

MHT may be prescribed during the perimenopause and early menopause for relief of menopausal symptoms and treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy. Progestational agents should be used for a minimum of 10 to 14 days per month in women treated with estrogen who have an intact uterus. MHT should be used in the lowest dose and for the shortest period necessary to control menopausal symptoms. MHT should be prescribed to women in conjunction with a thorough discussion of the possible relationship of MHT to breast cancer. It remains possible that transdermal estradiol with [orally administered] progesterone, which more closely mimics the normal physiology and metabolism of endogenous sex hormones, may provide a different risk-benefit profile. ","Patient acceptance and prior experience are the main factors in determining the preferred route of delivery.  Each postmenopausal woman should be provided with an individualized evaluation regarding the benefits and risks of MHT, in consultation with her treating physician. The “one-size-fits-all” approach to education, counseling, and treatment is inappropriate","estrogen alone is prescribed for women who have undergone a hysterectomy. In women with an intact uterus, a progestational agent should be added to the estrogen to protect the endometrium from the risk of unopposed estrogen causing development of hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. The dose of estrogen should be the lowest amount necessary to provide relief from symptoms or bone protection, with consideration for the patient's age. ","MHT is approved for the treatment of vaginal atrophy. The use of transvaginal estrogen may be considered to provide topical effects with less systemic absorption. Vaginal administration of estrogen has been used for treatment of vaginal atrophy (Grade B). Of note, this treatment can have systemic effects, depending on the dose and form (tablet, ring, or cream) of the estrogen. ","Does not emphasize  mental health as a symptom of menopause, nor are multiple lines of treatment offered. estrogen therapy may improve mood disorders (depression). t should be emphasized that not all mood disorders or cognitive disruption that coincides with menopause should be attributed to menopause per se without an evaluation of psychosocial, medical, or other issues that may occur at the time of menopause. ","estrogen therapy may improve  cognitive disruption, and sexual dysfunction during early menopause (15 [EL 1; RCT], 16 [EL 4; NE]). It should be emphasized that not all mood disorders or cognitive disruption that coincides with menopause should be attributed to menopause per se without an evaluation of psychosocial, medical, or other issues that may occur at the time of menopause. ","For women who cannot or do not wish to use estrogen for control of severe vasomotor symptoms, lifestyle changes should be implemented first. If pharmacologic therapy is needed, the most effective nonestrogen class of agents is the antidepressants. Venlafaxine is probably the most beneficial in this class. If antidepressants are not tolerated or cannot be used, then clonidine or megestrol may be considered, although side effects may occur more frequently with these agents. Gabapentin can be considered as a promising new therapeutic option, although both long-term efficacy and safety remain to be substantiated. Data on most nutritional supplements are limited by the lack of placebo-controlled trials and by existing trials that have generally shown no differences in results between such therapy and placebo. Because soy may have some estrogen agonist properties, long-term safety issues, especially in patients with breast cancer, remain of concern for high-dose therapy. A healthful diet that incorporates some soy protein seems reasonable. Phytoestrogens, including soy-derived isoflavonoids, result in inconsistent relief of symptoms. Because these compounds may have estrogenic effects, women with a personal or strong family history of hormonedependent cancers (breast, uterine, or ovarian), thromboembolic events, or cardiovascular events should not use soy-based therapies. Over-the-counter supplements should be used with caution because they are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have the potential for interactions with drugs and for causing harm. Custom compounded “bioidentical hormone therapy” is not recommended. FDA-approved bioidentical hormone preparations may be considered, but evidence is lacking that they are safer or more effective than traditional forms of hormone therapy.  Claims that treatment with compounded bioidentical hormones is safer, more effective, and free of side effects in comparison with pharmacologically produced agents are not substantiated by a systematic review of current scientific literature.   Lifestyle measures, including regular weightbearing exercise, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, smoking cessation, and prevention of falls, should be encouraged for preservation of bone mass and prevention of fractures. Lifestyle changes designed to maintain a cool environment and aid heat dissipation may help with mild to moderate vasomotor symptoms. The use of fans, air conditioning, and light cotton clothing may be helpful. Relaxation therapy may also be beneficial in some patients","The role of MHT in the prevention of disorders associated with both aging and the menopausal state affect the brain, skeleton, integument, and urogenital and cardiovascular systems remains controversial. cardioprotection may be provided by the use of MHT—especially estrogen therapy alone (without a progestin)—when it is prescribed for women early during the menopausal transition.However, MHT should not be initiated for the primary or secondary prevention of CAD. ","Estrogen therapy has been associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolic disease within 1 to 2 years after initiation of therapy. The use of the transdermal route of estrogen administration should be considered in order to avoid the hepatic “first-pass effect,” which may theoretically reduce the risk of thromboembolic disease. Because of the increased risk of endometrial cancer, unopposed estrogen should not be used in women with an intact uterus.  the choice of progestational agent may be the most important factor in observations of breast cancer risk. Recent studies suggest that the use of micronized progesterone in comparison with medroxyprogesterone and the avoidance of combined continuous therapy may be associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in MHT users. Women should be advised that smoking increases the risk of cardiovascular and venous thromboembolic disease when taking estrogen, and aggressive smoking cessation programs should be advised. Concordant with current FDA warnings, we recommend that women who are at increased risk of thromboembolic disease should not take estrogen-containing therapy. Women should be advised that cerebrovascular accidents occur with increased frequency in patients taking estrogen alone or E+P combination therapies in an age-dependent manner. Women should be advised that there may be an increase in ovarian epithelial tumors with the use of estrogen for more than 10 years.

If you are interested in taking HRT, your healthcare professional should discuss the benefits and risks with you before you start the treatment. You should also be informed about available alternatives to HRT along with their benefits and risks.  If you have a uterus (womb) then a combination of estrogen and progestogen HRT (combined HRT) would be recommended. Estrogen alone can cause abnormal thickening of the lining of your uterus, which can lead to bleeding. Adding progestogen will prevent this. If you have had a hysterectomy then you will be offered estrogen-only HRT.If combined HRT is started before you have the menopause or within 12 months of your last period then you will be offered a ‘cyclical’ combined HRT, which should give you regular monthly withdrawal bleeds.If you start combined HRT more than 12 months after your last period, you may be offered ‘continuous’ combined HRT (bleed-free HRT). There are no set time limits for how long you can be on HRT. The benefits and risks of taking HRT will depend on your individual situation. You can stop your HRT suddenly or  reduce gradually before stopping it. The chances of your symptoms coming back is the same either way.","If you are interested in taking HRT, your healthcare professional should discuss the benefits and risks with you before you start the treatment. This discussion should cover both the short-term (over the next 5 years) and the longer term (beyond the next 5 years) benefits and risks for you.

You should also be informed about available alternatives to HRT along with their benefits and risks.","Treatment options for menopausal symptoms include lifestyle changes, non-prescribed treatments and prescribed treatments.If you are troubled with hot flushes and night sweats, you should be offered HRT after discussing its benefits and risks. You may wish to discuss the alternative options described above with your healthcare professional.","Many women find using vaginal moisturisers and lubricants helpful for vaginal dryness. Estrogen given vaginally in the form of a tablet, cream or ring is effective in treating vaginal dryness. Low-dose vaginal estrogens can be used for as long as you need to and can also be safely used in combination with HRT. These can also reduce bladder infections and help urinary symptoms. If you experience any unexpected vaginal bleeding, you should tell your healthcare professional. Other forms of HRT can also help with vaginal dryness.","HRT is an effective treatment for low mood. CBT is also helpful in treating low mood and anxiety related to the menopause. Low mood as a result of the menopause is different from depression. Antidepressants are not helpful unless you have been diagnosed with depression. If you are on antidepressants, it is safe to take HRT as well as use CBT.","HRT containing estrogen and/or progestogen may be helpful as treatment for low sexual desire during menopause. If this doesn’t work then you should talk to your healthcare professional about whether to consider another hormone called testosterone, which is linked to sex drive in both men and women.","Regular aerobic exercise, such as running and swimming, may help, as may low-intensity exercise, such as yoga. Reducing your intake of caffeine and alcohol may also help to reduce hot flushes and night sweats.
 Plants or plant extracts, such as St John’s wort, black cohosh and isoflavones (soya products), can help reduce hot flushes and night sweats for some women. However, their safety is unknown and they can react with other medicines that you may be taking for conditions such as breast cancer, epilepsy, heart disease or asthma. You should check with your healthcare professional before taking any herbal medicine. Alternative therapies such as acupressure, acupuncture or homeopathy may help some women. More research is, however, required on the benefits from these therapies and, if they are used, this should be done with advice from qualified professionals.Commercially available ‘bioidentical’ hormones are not regulated or licensed in the UK owing to lack of evidence that they are effective or safe to use.
 Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of psychological treatment. You may be offered CBT for low mood or anxiety related to menopause.",It is not known whether HRT affects the development of dementia.,"HRT with estrogen alone (used for women who have no uterus) is associated with little or no increased risk of breast cancer.HRT with estrogen and progestogen can increase your risk of breast cancer. This risk is higher the longer you stay on it and reduces when you stop HRT. Your individual risk of developing breast cancer depends on underlying risk factors, such as your body weight and your drinking and smoking habits.
HRT taken as a tablet increases your risk of developing a blood clot, which is not the case if HRT is taken as a patch or gel.
HRT in tablet form slightly increases your risk of stroke, although the overall risk of stroke is very low if you are under the age of 60 years.",UK,"includes an identity disclaimer for use of the word ""women"" / ""woman"" in indication of menopause sufferers.",,"approaches treatmenrt more holisticlly, does not emphasize MHT over everything else as much as other guidelines.

https://www.menopause.org.au/hp/management,AMS (Australasian Menopause Society),,,AMS Website,updated 2023?,Menopause Management Information Sheets,"MHT is the most effective treatment for hot flushes and night sweats.Non-oral routes of administration have fewer risks than oral preparations.The dose and duration of MHT should be consistent with treatment goals, such as symptom relief, and should be individualized. As a general rule, cyclical hormone therapy is used for a woman who is in the menopausal transition and is having some irregular spontaneous menses or is very recently postmenopausal, but it can be continued longer if preferred. Continuous hormone therapy is a convenience often preferred by older women. A full history and clinical examination should be done, exploring possible contraindications or relative contraindications to MHT or to specific formulae.
Mammograms, breast checks and cervical screening should be up to date in all women over 50 years whether they are taking MHT or not.
Any unexplained vaginal bleeding should be investigated.","Ensure the patient understands benefits and risks. The choice of oestrogen dose depends upon how a woman's symptoms respond and on her well-being, not on measurement of blood levels.. ","MHT is the most effective treatment for hot flushes and night sweats.
Only women with an intact uterus need the addition of a progestogen.
Oestrogen reduces hot flushes, improves vaginal dryness and sleep and increases bone density. After hysterectomy MHT/HRT only needs to contain oestrogen. The safety profile of the delivery methods differ and some women will be better advised to use a non-oral route of administration.Tibolone is indicated for the management of vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause and for the prevention of bone loss.   It can be considered an alternative to conventional MHT where improvement in libido is desired.   Its effect on lipid metabolism and haemostasis are less certain, while the long-term effects of tibolone on breast cancer and cardiovascular disease remain unknown.  It is not recommended for use in women with a history of breast cancer and should be used with caution in women over age 60 because of the increased stroke risk.  Tibolone is associated with a higher rate of unscheduled bleeding than placebo but a lower rate than combined MHT. A selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) called bazedoxefine, has been combined with conjugated equine oestrogens in what is referred to as a tissue selective oestrogen complex (TSEC) with the trade name Duavive™. It is used to prevent osteoporosis and treat menopausal symptoms without the need for a progestogen in women with an intact uterus and at least 12 months since last menses, used to treat/ prevent several conditions such as osteoporosis, infertility and hormone responsive cancers. Fezolinetant is a neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist and treats the mechanism underlying hot flushes. There is evidence that some antidepressants, gabapentin, and oxybutinin all reduce hot flushes. Clonidine is no longer recommended for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. Gabapentin is alsio more effective than placebo. Stellate ganglion block also involves injection of anaesthetic agent to block the sympathetic nervous chain, via a lower cervical or upper thoracic approach.  It has been useful for reducing moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms in some studies","MHT also effectively treats vaginal dryness. Ideally, all older women with symptoms suggestive of GSM should be examined to exclude other causes of genital symptoms, such as dermatitis, sexually transmitted infections, Lichen Sclerosis, Lichen Planus and vulval neoplasia.Regular use of vaginal moisturisers, such as polycarbophil gel or hyaluronic vaginal gel 0.2% may help relieve general vulvovaginal dryness. Lubricants may be useful for sexual activity. The vaginal oestrogen options currently available in Australia contain oestriol (available as cream and vaginal ovules) or oestradiol (available as vaginal tablets). There is no need for progestogen when vaginal oestrogens are used in recommended dosages as the amount absorbed systemically is insufficient to induce endometrial thickening.17
Vaginal oestrogens can safely be used in addition to systemic menopausal hormone therapy if vaginal symptoms persist.topical vaginal DHEA preparation (prasterone 6.5 mg) indicated significant improvement in vaginal dryness, vaginal pH and dyspareunia 20, 21 and it is now indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe menopausal vulvovaginal symptoms in Australia.
Ospemifene is an oestrogen agonist in the vaginal epithelium and is used to treat dyspareunia.Lasofoxifene is available in a few countries in Europe for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and treatment of vaginal atrophy and has been investigated for the treatment of resistant ER positive breast cancer. ","Mental illness is prevalent in all age groups and for women this manifests as affective and anxiety orders. The menopausal transition is a time of increased risk.
The presentation of mood disturbance in the menopause transition appears unique with less sadness, increased anger, irritability and fluctuation in severity of symptoms. Assessment of psychosocial stressors, menopausal symptoms and mood is necessary.
Most women with will benefit from education about the menopause transition and are likely to respond to treatment, if needed. An individualized approach and comprehensive discussion about treatment options is recommended for each patient.

Lifestyle changes which may modify mood should be implemented as part of a holistic model of care. A meta-analysis found that low- moderate intensity exercise reduces depressive symptoms in midlife and older women (8).

Psychological therapy may be helpful. Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of cognitive behavioural therapy (9).

Antidepressants may be indicated for perimenopausal depression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors have also been shown to improve VMS. It should be noted that some SSRI/SNRIs can cause sweating. While SSRIs are generally considered first line, desvenlafaxine has been shown to be efficacious in two randomised, double blind placebo-controlled trials in peri- and post-menopausal women (2). Of note, the SSRIs and SNRIs have side effects that may result in sexual dysfunction.

Use of SSRIs in women with breast cancer using tamoxifen. There have been concerns that certain SSRIs (paroxetine and fluoxetine) may reduce the active metabolite of tamoxifen.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) may help women who have symptoms of low mood related to perimenopause or menopause (10). However, MHT is not currently recommended as a first line treatment for major depression (2). MHT may be of particular benefit for mood and sleep quality in women experiencing VMS and can be considered in combination with antidepressants. Evidence from RCTs suggests oestrogen is as effective as antidepressants in perimenopausal women but is ineffective in post-menopausal women (2) suggesting a window of opportunity for its use in the perimenopause. Some evidence exists for the efficacy of MHT in the prevention of the onset of depression in euthymic perimenopausal women; at present there is insufficient evidence to recommend prescribing MHT for prevention of depression.","for improvement of sexual function/libido, Start by optimising oestrogen therapy. A trial of testosterone therapy may be appropriate for some women whose symptoms do not improve on MHT alone.Testosterone – is sometimes added to MHT and may improve libido and energy in some women. Tibolone improves sexual function in women with low libido, compared to placebo in clinical trials, which may be due to tibolone's combined oestrogenic and androgenic properties. (5, 6) .  Whether there is any advantage of tibolone compared to conventional MHT is unclear.  The use of oestrogen, alone or in combination with a progestogen, has been shown to improve the subjective quality of sleep. Hypnotics should not be used in situations other than for acute sleep problems because of their side effects, tolerance and withdrawal issues. The serotonin modulating antidepressants have been shown to improve hot flushes, depression and insomnia. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, to include stimulus control and sleep restriction therapies have shown improvement in sleep (1). These approaches are shown to be equally efficacious to pharmacotherapy with longer term sustainability. The use of supplemental melatonin in rapid release formulations (eg crushing the prescription forms of modified release melatonin) and light therapy (both at the appropriate time of day) have been shown to improve the circadian rhythm","Evidence for the effectiveness of lifestyle and behaviour modifications for menopausal symptoms is mixed, limited or non-existent. Evidence suggests that weight gain increases the severity of vasomotor symptoms so maintaining healthy weight might be helpful.Australasian Menopause Society does not endorse the use of compounded bioidentical hormone therapies.
No evidence exists for the effectiveness of lifestyle changes such as exercising or controlling environmental temperature although these might help with comfort and wellbeing. Cognitive behavioural therapy has been demonstrated to improve sleep, mood and bother of vasomotor symptoms, and in some studies to reduce the frequency of vasomotor symptoms4.
No evidence exists showing that breathing and relaxation practices reduce the severity of symptoms – there is mixed evidence for yoga. Hypnosis has been shown to reduce vasomotor symptoms severity and frequency, and has been useful for reducing anxiety and improving sleep. Limited evidence suggests that hypnosis might improve menopausal symptoms but there is no evidence that acupuncture, magnetic therapy, reflexology or chiropractic interventions are effective. Most non-hormonal treatments only treat hot flushes and night sweats. There is a substantial placebo effect.Non-prescription remedies have generally shown no or minimal benefit. Little solid scientific evidence exists to support claims for alternative therapy benefiting menopausal health.
Whilst some studies support a benefit for soy foods or extracts to reduce vasomotor symptoms, the evidence is inconsistent, and a meta-analysis reported no overall benefit in treating menopausal symptoms. Black cohosh has been shown in some trials to reduce hot flushes and improve mood in menopausal women. A meta-analysis has reported a comparable effect to low dose hormone therapy, with a good safety profile8.","MHT reduces the risk of postmenopausal bone fracture, including hip fracture. The effect of tibolone on preventing bone loss is similar to MHT.","For the majority of symptomatic women, the benefits of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) outweigh the risks.
Consider the risks and benefits of MHT in the individual prior to commencing treatment.
Aim to commence MHT within the first 10 years after menopause.
Consider the use of transdermal preparations to reduce the risk of thromboembolism.
Micronised progesterone and dydrogesterone may be associated with lower risks compared with other progestogens
There is no evidence of increased breast cancer risk with the use of vaginal oestrogen. Oral oestrogen increases the risk of blood clots (venous thromboembolism). The risk increases with age and other risk factors such as obesity, previous thromboembolism, smoking and immobility. Oral oestrogen is associated with an increased risk of gallbladder inflammation . Oestrogen alone does not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer. Oral oestrogen increases the risk of stroke and the risk increases with age. In a woman with an intact uterus, unopposed oestrogen therapy increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Cessation of MHT is associated with increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and increased risk of fracture . The thrombotic effects of MHT containing oral oestrogen are associated with a slightly increased risk of stroke and venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) but not of coronary heart disease. The risk of DVT in most women is low. Take note of risk factors predisposing women to VTE prior to commencing MHT.
Individualise all treatment based on the patient, her clinical features, her needs and her risk assessment.
If MHT is to be used in a woman assessed to be at high risk of developing a DVT, a transdermal preparation should be used.

Menopausal hormone therapy can be safely initiated in women without contraindications who are younger than 60 years of age or less than 10 years post-menopause. Menopausal hormone therapy should be individualized after careful consideration of symptoms, medical conditions, health risks, family history, treatment goals, patient preferences, and timing of last menstrual period. There is no specific time frame for duration of systemic menopausal hormone therapy, and treatment duration should be individualized.  Periodic re-evaluation of menopausal hormone therapy is recommended . Women who have experienced loss of ovarian function or with decreased ovarian function before the age of 45 years should consider replacement hormone therapy until the average age of menopause. Estrogen-progestogen regimens can be continuous (i.e., estrogen-progestogen taken every day) or follow a cyclic regimen, with estrogen taken every day and progestogen taken for 12–14 days every month. In women with hysterectomy, estrogen alone can be taken every day . Non-hormonal prescription therapies can be considered when hormone therapy is contraindicated or not desired . MHT doses should be titrated to effect when managing VMS, starting with low to standard estrogen doses. There is no consistent recommendation for stopping MHT; the dose can be either tapered or abruptly dis- continued.. ","Menopausal hormone therapy should be individualized after careful consideration of symptoms, medical conditions, health risks, family history, treatment goals, patient preferences, and timing of last menstrual period. Recognize that patient choices will vary by individual and that clinicians must help patients arrive at a care decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences.. ","For the management of vasomotor symptoms, menopausal hormone therapy is the most effective option and can be safely initiated in women without contraindications who are younger than 60 years of age or less than 10 years post-menopause. Options for menopausal hormone therapy for vasomotor symptoms in women with a uterus include estrogen-progestogen therapy, a tissue-selective estrogen complex, or tibolone. Estrogen alone can be used in women who have had a hysterectomy. Non-hormonal prescription therapies, including certain antidepressant agents, gabapentinoids, clonidine, and oxybutynin, may offer some relief from hot flashes but have their own adverse effects. None are as effective as estrogen, and the response rate among women is variable.The conjugated estrogen−bazedoxifene combination (TSEC, SERM) has also been found to be effective in reducing VMS when compared with placebo. tibolone (tibella) is also an option, being more effective than placebo, but slightly less effective than EPT, in reducing VMS in postmenopausal women.","Local vaginal estrogen therapy is appropriate for treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). The doses used in vaginal estrogen are so low that they produce little to minimal increase in serum estradiol levels. They may be used in women with contraindications to systemic estrogen. Concurrent progestogen therapy is not needed when using recommended doses of vaginal estrogen for genitourinary symptoms. Other newer options for the treatment of GSM: prasterone, a vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; Intrarosa), and ospemi- fene, a SERM (Osphena). The efficacy of prasterone on mod- erate to severe dyspareunia and vaginal dryness has been demonstrated. Ospemifene shows significant improvement in dys- pareunia and vaginal dryness.

There is emerging evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy may have positive effects on vasomotor symptoms . There is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of any one natural health product for the management of moderate to severe hot flashes . A healthy diet during menopause can reduce the risk of future chronic conditions, aid in weight management, and improve energy levels. For cultural traditional therapies, women should be offered the opportunity to work with a cultural leader; health care providers can discuss this option in partnership with women, in order to ensure cultural humility and cultural safety. behavioural modifications such as yoga, weight loss, and exercise, although they may provide other health bene- fits, cannot be recommended for moderate to severe bothersome VMS because of lack of evidence for efficacy.
